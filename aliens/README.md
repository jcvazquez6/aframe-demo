# APCSP: A-Frame Demo Earth and Moon

A-Frame demonstration program with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

## Getting Started

Log in to your Cloud 9 account and create a new HTML 5 workspace.  When you're creating the workspace you must clone the [repo](https://github.com/JaffeAPCSP/aframe-demo-earth-moon.git) to initialize your workspace.

## Start the web server

In the Cloud 9 terminal enter the comment <code>sudo service start apache2</code>

## Opening the webpage

* Click the Share link in the top right corner of your Cloud 9 workspace
* Click the middle link, then click Copy
* Open a new web browser window and paste the URL you just copied

You'll see the playing field for the Ninja Star.  You can also load the webpage on your Android phone and use a Google Cardboard unit to get the full VR effect.

## Explore the code

Open the <code>index.html</code> and javascript files in the <code>js</code> folder.  Make small adjustments in the code, save the changes, then reload the webpage to see the effect of your changes.

See if you can do the following:

* Make the Ninja star spin the other way
* Change the speed of the Aliens
* Make the Aliens move across the playing field at an angle rather than straight across
* Raise the elevation of the camera a bit
* Move the camera way up in the air and look down on the playing field
* Make the Alien fall to the ground faster when it's hit with the Ninja star
* Increase the size of the Alien and/or the Ninja star
* Change the time delay between when the Alien gets hit with the Ninja star and when it disappears
